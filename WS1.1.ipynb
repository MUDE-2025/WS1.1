    "\n",
    "We often want to do the same operation on a series of values. As you probably can tell, this quickly becomes extremely tedious and inefficient. Loops are a great way to iterate through a series of values using the same set of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a loop you fundamentally need two things. The first is a set of values you want to iterate through. The second is the loop itself. In the example below, there is a list with three different beam lengths. This will act as our set of values to iterate through. Next, there is the loop itself. The first line defines the 'running scope' of the loop, i.e., for what set of values you are running the loop for. The syntax in this case is 'for x in y'. In this case, each x is called a 'length' and the y we we iterate through is beam_lengths. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside this loop, the operations then take place. In the first iteration, the loop takes the first entry in the list, 4, and uses this value to calculate the total load. In the next iteration, the loop will take the next entry in the list, 5 and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "**A note on equal signs**\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note is that the equals sign here works a bit differently than an equals sign in maths. Instead of saying that A is the same as B, the equals sign **assigns** A to B. In the first task, you can see that beam_length = 6. In this case, we take the integer 6 and assign it to beam_length. This means that if we want to assign a value of 7 to beam_length, we can simply type beam_length = 7. Because the value is being **assigned** to beam_length, we won't have any issues with the fact that 6 is not equal to 7. When you assign a value, you override the previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same thing happens in the loop below loop. For each time the loop runs, a new value is assigned to total_length. The value is then printed out. In the next loop, the old value is overwritten by the new value.\n"
