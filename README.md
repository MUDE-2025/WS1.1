*Due: `You do not need to hand this in`.*

Now that you have completed all the steps to set up your computer and environment, it is time to try out a few Python functionalities in your shiny new setup!
Please open the file `WS1.1_Warming_Up.ipynb` in VS code and work through the notebook. 
For those of you who are familiar with Python, this will go very quickly! For those of you that this is new for, take your time. This does not need to be handed in. 

For those of you who need extra help to get started, we will be running tutorials next week on Tuesday in 1.98 at 10:45.
